      {# NOTE: Before using jinja logic, we had been generating html in compengine and then passing it through jinja as a variable i.e., {{content|safe}}. However, this allowed for html/js injection which would be very bad for security. Thus, all html generation must be done with jinja logic. (same for history) #}
